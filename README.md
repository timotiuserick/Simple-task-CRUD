# Simple-task-CRUD

it's simpler to test it in localhost
import the sql file to import the database first

The program use simple ajax to coordinate all of the methods
So it is a single page application

See the task list below,
the tasks can be edited or deleted
And user can also create new task above

Why i choose to use ajax ?
Because it is better to implement API based in web development these days

It still has so many room for improvements, including for the UI
